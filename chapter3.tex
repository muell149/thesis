\chapter{EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS}

\section{The Large Hadron Collider}
The most powerful machine of its kind, the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) accelerates and collides particles
at high center-of-mass energies producing rare
particles and interactions that would be otherwise unobservable
in the laboratory, making it the best tool available for studying \tth
processes. The LHC is a circular particle accelerator/collider. Measuring 27 km
in circumference, it collides beams of protons in head-on collisions       
at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV.

The LHC itself is technically the final element in a series of machines
that accelerate the beams from rest to succesively higher energies. This system of
of accelerators, referred to as the LHC Accelerator Complex is depicted below in
Figure~\ref{fig:lhc_complex}.

The acceleration is accomplished with radio frequency
(RF) cavities. RF cavities are a linear series of cylindrical conductors,
which sustain a resonant electromagnetic field produced by a generator. As 
charged particles pass through the cavities, they experience a force
(acceleration) from the resonant alternating field in each cavity.

This acceleration process begins with Hydrogen gas in the linear accelerator
(LINAC 2). The Hydrogen atoms in the gas are stripped of electrons
in an applied electric field, leaving only protons, which are then accelerated
along the linear beam pipe with RF cavities to an energy of 50 MeV. 

After the LINAC, the beams of protons enter the Proton Synchrontron Booster rings where
they are accelerated to 1.4 GeV, before reaching the Proton
Synchrotron (PS). The circular PS, measuring more than 600 m
in circumference, accelerates the beams to 25 GeV before injection into the
larger, Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS). The SPS at over 7 km around, provides the final
acceleration before the beams reach the LHC at an energy 450 GeV. The SPS injects the beams into
the LHC in opposite directions.

As a result of the RF cavity acceleration, the beams are comprised of independent
trains of 'bunches' of protons. After the beams are fully injected, the LHC ramps the beam energy to 6.5 TeV per beam,
providing 13 TeV center-of-mass proton collisions.

The center-of-mass energy and time-spacing between proton bunches in the LHC are critical to studying interesting
and rare physics processes. A sufficient center-of-mass collision energy is needed to produce new, heavy particles.
With the current center-of-mass collision energy of 13 TeV, any particle with mass less than or equal to this, is 
within reach of the LHC. Because many interesting physics processes are exceedingly rare (small cross section), such as \tth, many collisions
are needed to produce such a process. There are over 2800 bunches in each beam, with each bunch spaced 25 ns apart. This spacing is choosen to
produce as many bunch crossings as possible, without overloading
the detector instrumentation and data acquisition. There are approximately $10^{11}$ protons in each bunch, but due to the small cross section of the protons,
only approximately 20 collisions occur in each bunch crossing. The beams travel around the LHC over 11,246 times per second, over 99.99$%$ the speed of light. 
This translates to around 600 million collisions per second. Thanks to these properties, the LHC
lends itself to producing rare and heavy processes.


The quantity used to describe the number of collisions occuring is called Luminosity.
Described in equation~\ref{eqn:lumi_inst} below, instantaneous luminosity represents the number of collisions (events) occuring per unit time.

\begin{equation}[htbp]
\label{eqn:lumi_inst}
 \mathcal{L}_{inst} = \frac{N_{b}^{2}n_{b}f_{\textnormal{rev}}\gamma}{4\pi \epsilon_{n} \beta^{*}}F
\end{equation}

Where $N_{b}$ is the number of protons per bunch, $n_{b}$ is the total number of bunches, $f_{\textnormal{rev}}$ is the number of beam revolutions around the LHC per
second, $\gamma$ is a relativistic factor, $\epsilon_{n}$ is factor related to beam emittance, $\beta^{*}$ is the beta function representing the beam cross section, and
$F$ describes the factor related to the crossing angle of the beams. Because not every collision can be recorded, knowing the total number of collisions is critically important
to every analysis at an LHC collider experiment. From the instantaneous luminosity, the total number of collisions in time interval $t$ can be calculated by integrating over time
in equation~\ref{eqn:num_coll} below. 

\begin{equation}[htbp]
\label{eqn:num_coll}
N_{pp} = \int \sigma_{pp}\mathcal{L}_{inst}dt 
\end{equation}

Inside the LHC, the beams travel in opposite directions in separate pipes adjacent to
one another. The beam pipes of the entire accelerator complex are kept at an ultra high vaccuum
to avoid detrimental beam interactions before the collisions. The beams are focused
and guided around the LHC with 392 quadrupole and 1232 dipole superconducting
magnets respectively.

The magnets produce a field of over 8 Tesla. This is accomplished via superconducting 
niobium-titanium coils. Cooled with liquid nitrogren and superfluid helium-4, these
magnets operate at 1.9 K and carry a current of over 11000 amperes. In addition to
the LHC, these magnets are used throughout the accelerator complex.

There are several detector experiments positioned on the LHC, the two general purpose, functionally equivalent detectors being ATLAS and CMS.
Each detector is centered on an interaction point, where the beams are steered into each other to produce the collisions. 
The motivation for having two detectors is to provide cross checks on results, as each result is produced with separate analysis teams, studying separate collsions
recorded with a separate detector.   

\section{The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) Detector}
The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector is a multi purpose particle detector designed to record and identify particles produced in collisions at the LHC, sitting 100 m underneath
the town of Cessy, France. CMS is comprised of layers of subdetectors which are connected to the trigger system and the data acquisition system.
The various subdetectors record information about the collision, while the trigger system and
data acquisition systems record and save the collisions. The acronym CMS comes from being more compact than its sister detector ATLAS, at 15 m in diameter and
over 21 m long. The name muon is because muons are the particles it detects with the greatest efficiency. The solenoid part of the name is due to the largest magnet of its kind
around which the detector is built. CMS is cylindrical in shape, as pictured in Figure~\ref{fig:cms_overview}. The various subdetectors and components are described in more
below.

\subsection{Coordinate System}

\subsection{Tracker}
\subsubsection{Pixel Detector}
The innermost piece of CMS is the tracking system, specifically the pixel detector. The pixel detector is comprised of 65 million silicon pixels, allowing it to record
precise trajectories of the charged particles resulting from collisions. Precise tracking information is critical to differentiating nearby particles, and identifying
exactly where an interesting collision took place. 

The pixel detector, about the size of a shoe box, contains 3 layers at 4 cm, 7 cm, and 11 cm from the beam.
The silicon material in the tracker is choosen specifically to disturb the particles as little as possible, while still providing accurate particle track reconstruction.
Additionally, the material is resistant to radiation, as it is only a few centimeters from the interaction point. Each pixel measurses 100 $\mu$m by 150 $\mu$m. 

As the particles travel through successive layers of silicon pixels, they leave points of impact on each pixel, known as hits.
The hits are measured with a precision of 10 $\mu$m, and the particle trajectory or track is reconstructed from collections of hits. 
As a particle travels through a pixel, it releases electrons from the silicon atoms, creating electron-hole pairs.
A voltage is applied to the pixel, attracting the free electrons and creating a small current, which is measured and translated to a hit. Small readout electronics
are attached to the back of each pixel to send the hit information to the data acquisition system, so the hit patterns can be reconstructed into particle tracks later.

   \caption[text in square brackets]{text in curly brackets}
   \label{fig:cms_tracker}
 \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Strip Detector}
Outside the pixel detector is the silicon strip detector. Here, silicon strips are favored over pixels as they are less costly, and the resolution provided by the pixels
is not necessary at greater distances from the interaction point, allowing for larger and fewer silicon modules. 

The silicon strip detector consists of about 10 million strips in 10 layers, extending to 130 cm from the beam. 
The strip detector is comprised of 4 distinct sections of silicon strips, depicted in
Figure~\ref{fig:cms_tracker}. The outer most sections are the tracker outer barrel (TOB) and tracker end cap (TEC+,-) sections. Between the TOB and the pixels, sits the tracker
inner barrel (TIB) section, and the tracker inner endcaps (TID+,-). The silicon strips in each section are different, specifically suited to that section.
Each silicon strip measures between 10-25 $\mu$m by 180 $\mu$m, depending on the section. The total detector area of the tracking system (pixels+strips) sums to more than
a tennis court of silicon. Precise tracking information is essential to measuring particle momenta and identifying particles in a strong magnetic field.

The strips detect particle tracks the same way as the pixels.

\subsection{ECAL}

After particles pass through the tracking system, they enter the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL). The ECAL measures the energy of the particles that interact via the
electromagnetic force, specifically electrons and photons.

The ECAL is comprised of over 75,000 scintillating lead tungstate ($PbWO_{4}$) crystals. The ECAL is made up of
three sections; the barrel, endcaps, and preshower, depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:cms_ecal}.

The choice of lead tungstate is motivated by needing to stop the particles, and
also scintillate effectively to allow an accurate energy readout and measurement. The stopping action is accomplished with the lead, while the scintillating is accomplished with
crystalline oxygen. These combined properties allow the crystals to produce photons (light) in proportion to the amount of energy deposited by the stopped particles.
