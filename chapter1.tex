\chapter{INTRODUCTION}

This is an overview of the introduction.  In here, I will use many
many buzzwords and other legalistic-types of terms, mostly beginning on
the expounding of the holistic and synergistic energy that Gnus bring
to our organizations. If you offer some food, they will take it and back off a
respectful distance in order to consume their food while leaving you
to your ``personal space.''

  Academic politics are the dirtiest, meanest, ugliest, and generally
  the most low-down, in-your-face, and kick-em-while-they're-down than
  anywhere else (even Washington D.C.)  because the stakes are so low.
