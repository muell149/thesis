\chapter{Boosted Decision Trees}
\label{app:bdts}
Boosted Decision Trees are the single MVA/machine learning technique used for discriminating signal from background
in this analysis. BDTs are a special instance of a decision tree, which is illustrated below in Figure~\ref{fig:dec_tree}.
This analysis uses the BDT implementation in the Toolkit for Multivariate Analysis (TMVA) software~\cite{tmva}.
The choice of BDTs over other MVA methods such as artificial neural networks (aNNs) or support vector machines (SVMs) is motivated
by several factors.
